DPRL Math Symbol Recognizers
Copyright (c) 2014 Siyu Zhu, Lei Hu, Richard Zanibbi

This collection of classifiers for isolated math symbol images was
created by Siyu Zhu on-and-off over a year-and-a-half. The code was 
written as a part of the Min system which is an interface of math 
equation recognition. 

The system was developed at the Rochester Institute of Technology in
Rochester, New York, USA, primarily in the Document and Pattern Recognition
Lab (DPRL) located within the Computer Science Department.
